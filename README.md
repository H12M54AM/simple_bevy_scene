# simple_bevy_scene

![Current Scene](./public/Current%20Scene.png)

My first Bevy project from a tutorial. Everything works and most things make sense. I have been watching [Logic Projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uKWIYEGBjs) start his 1st part in making his own game.

This project is not that, but it deffinatley showed me how the setup process of a Bevy project works.

Will run natively on system. The first complie when developing will be the longest because you are compiliing the entire engine. Not having any LLDs or Linkers installed increases the complie time for each run. 

* MacOS doesent support Mold yet.
